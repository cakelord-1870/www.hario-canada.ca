Not only that, it updates the aesthetic significantly, bringing the syphon into the modern age. However, it's not just aesthetics getting an update. Along with the classic cloth filter, Hario have designed an amazing metal filter that gives your coffee more body, and leaves a little sediment - akin to a Able Kone filter. Everything you need comes in the box, apart from the alcohol to fuel the included burner. Whilst the burner that is included works, it will make getting the best out of this brew method much more challenging and frustrating (this is the same with every syphon that you can buy).
